 ##### ” إن فى الجنة باب يقال له ” الريان” ، يقال له يوم القيامة: أين الصائمون ؟ هل لكم إلى الريان؟ من دخله لم يظمأ بعده أبدا ، فإذا دخلوا ، أغلق عليهم ، فلم يدخل فيه أحد غيرهم
 ##### “   The Messenger of Allah ( PBUH) said, “In Paradise, there is a gate called ” Ar- Rayyan.It will be said on the Day of Resurrection,” Where are those who used to fast? Would you like to enter through Ar-Rayyan? Whoever enters through it will never feel thirsty again.Then when they have entered, it will be closed behind them, and no one but they will enter through it

## Todays challenge description [ The Squide game 🦑 ] :

*“You won’t get caught if you hide behind someone.”*

Sang-Woo advises Gi-Hun to hide behind someone to avoid getting shot.

Gi-Hun follows Sang-Woo's advice and hides behind Ali, who saved his life earlier. Gi-Hun and Ali both have the same height, KKK. Many players saw this trick and also started hiding behind Ali.

Now, there are N players standing between Gi-Hun and Ali in a straight line, with the i'th player having height H(i)​. Gi-Hun wants to know the minimum number of players who need to get shot so that Ali is visible in his line of sight.

Note:

    Line of sight is a straight line drawn between the topmost point of two objects. Ali is visible to Gi-Hun if nobody between them crosses this line.
    Even if there are some players who have the same height as that of Gi-Hun and Ali, Ali will be visible in Gi-Hun's line of sight.
    Gi-Hun and Ali have the same height.

### Input Format

    
    The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K, denoting the total number of players between Gi-Hun and Ali and the height of both of them respectively.
    The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, denoting the heights of the players between Gi-Hun and Ali.


### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of players who need to get shot so that Ali is visible in Gi-Hun's line of sight.

            1≤T≤10^5
            1≤N≤10^5
            1≤K≤10^6
           1≤H(i)​≤10^6 for every 1≤i≤N.
           

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 3 |2|
|4 10|1|
|2 13 4 16|0|
|5 8| |
|9 3 8 8 4 | |
|4 6 | |
|1 2 3 4 | |

### Explanation:

 - **Test case 1**: Gi-Hun and Ali have height 10. For Ali to be visible to Gi-Hun, the second person (with height 13) and the fourth person (with height 16) need to get shot. Hence, the minimum number of players who need to get shot is 2.

 - **Test case 2**: Gi-Hun and Ali have height 8. For Ali to be visible to Gi-Hun, the first person (with height 9) needs to get shot. Hence, the minimum number of players who need to get shot is 1.

 - **Test case 3**: Nobody needs to get shot because everyone is shorter than Gi-Hun and Ali.
