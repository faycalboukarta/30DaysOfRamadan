## Todays challenge description [ Saving Taxes ] :


In ITland, everyone who earns strictly more than Y Dinars per year, has to pay a tax to gov. The gov has allowed a special scheme where you can invest any amount of money and claim exemption for it.

You have earned X (X>Y) Dinars this year. Find the minimum amount of money you have to invest so that you don't have to pay taxes this year.

### Input Format

    
    
    The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
    Each test case consists of a single line of input consisting of two space separated integers X and Y denoting the amount you earned and the amount above which you will have to pay taxes.



### Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer, denoting the minimum amount you need to invest.

### Constraints

            1≤T≤100
            1≤Y<X≤100

           

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 4 |2|
|4 2|1|
|8 7|4|
|5 8|1|
|5 1| |
|2 1| |


### Explanation:

 - **Test case 1**: The amount above which you will have to pay taxes is 2. Since you earn 4 Dinars, you need to invest at least 2 Dinars. After investing 2 dinars, you will remain with an effective income 4−2=24 Dinars which will not be taxed.

 - **Test case 2**: The amount above which you will have to pay taxes is 7. Since you earn 8 Dinars, you need to invest at least 1 Dinars.

 - **Test case 3**: The amount above which you will have to pay taxes is 1. Since you earn 5 Dinars, you need to invest at least 4 Dinars.
 
 - **Test case 4**: The amount above which you will have to pay taxes is 1. Since you earn 2 dinars, you need to invest at least 1 Dinars.
